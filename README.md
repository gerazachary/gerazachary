### Hi folks! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gera Zachary (a.k.a Zacha)

I work as a full stack developer with focus on backend technologies and teacher in the city's University. I'm living in Rafaela (Santa FÃ©), Argentina.

I began to work in 2012 and from there to this point, passed through several programming languages and development areas: frontend, middleend and backend. I like all of them (psht! but my favourites are middleend and backend ðŸ˜‰).

## What i'm doing currently?
I'm focusing on learning Go and try to apply the knowledge dooing personal projects with it outside working hours. I fell in love with the language!  
Also i'm polishing my C# skill with games development in Unity 3D from time to time and spend some free time working on every crazy idea that comes to my mind, for example [Mirror Suite](https://mirror-suite.com): an online platform that serves as a mock server and error logger for Java Applications.

## How do I work?
- I'm very proactive and fast learner.
- I enjoy helping other devs with their problems. Just contact me! ðŸ˜„
- I'm constantly learning and searching new technologies, languages, tools, architecture, patterns...Knowledge does not take up space!
